# Effect of Privacy Notices on Trust with Social Robots
## Nishchal Jagadeesha, Taha

## Abstract
While social robots offer significant potential for personal and social assistance, their use raises critical privacy concerns, especially in home environments. This study investigates the effectiveness of privacy notice mechanisms in robots, comparing software-based solutions with embodied methods. Through a mixed method research study with 13 participants (6M, 6F, 1NB) from Purdue University, we evaluate their perceived level of privacy in the presence of a social robot. We found that (1) embodied privacy notice was perceived more effective in ensuring user privacy than software-based privacy notice, (2) participants with prior exposure to social robots were less comfortable having private conversations around a social robot than participants without prior exposure. and (3) women were more comfortable sharing sensitive information in the presence of a social robot than men.
